# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **First-class project tools** — Unity plugin tools with `projectToolName` metadata are now exposed directly in MCP `tools/list` with their declared schemas, while still remaining callable through `unity_advanced_tool` as a stale-metadata fallback.
- **`unity_asset_refresh` core tool** — Expose AssetDatabase refresh/import-specific-path refresh as a first-class MCP tool instead of requiring `unity_advanced_tool`.
- **First-class Unity plugin routes** — `_meta/tools` entries with `firstClass=true` are now exposed directly in MCP `tools/list` with their route-owned schemas and descriptions, instead of requiring `unity_advanced_tool`.
- **`unity_project_tools_execute` tool** — Adds a concrete project-tool execution fallback so agents do not need `unity_advanced_tool` while waiting for direct project tools to refresh.

### Fixed
- **Fast project-tool discovery** — `tools/list` now returns static tools and cached Unity plugin metadata without waiting on the Editor, preventing MCP clients from dropping the Unity server during startup. Live metadata refresh still happens through catalog/execution paths and updates a long-lived cache for future sessions.
- **Queue failure details** — Failed queue tickets now preserve Unity's structured `error`, `message`, `errorCode`, and `retryable` fields instead of collapsing to `Queue processing failed`.

## [2.30.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **`unity_screenshot_editor_window` tool** — capture any Editor window (Inspector, Project, Console, custom windows) to a PNG file. Unlike `unity_screenshot_game` / `unity_screenshot_scene` (which render a camera), it grabs the actual editor UI via the Win32 `PrintWindow` API, so it works even when the window is hidden behind others, without raising it or stealing focus. **Windows editor only** — returns a clear unsupported-platform error on macOS/Linux. Defaults to `Assets/Screenshots/`, accepts any user-chosen `.png` path; args `window` (required), `path`, `maxDimension`. Companion to the `unity-mcp-plugin` 2.32.0 change.

## [2.29.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **MPPM virtual player & scenario tools** — `unity_mppm_list_players`, `unity_mppm_activate_player`, `unity_mppm_deactivate_player` (manage Multiplayer Play Mode virtual players) and `unity_mppm_create_scenario` (create a ScenarioConfig asset). Companion to the `unity-mcp-plugin` 2.31.0 MPPM changes; the existing `unity_mppm_*` scenario tools also got clearer descriptions.

## [2.28.3] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- **`instanceId` tool parameters declared as `string`** — Unity 6.5 entity ids are 64-bit values that exceed JavaScript's safe-integer range; sent as JSON numbers they were rounded, breaking object-by-`instanceId` resolution. All 26 `instanceId` input schemas in `editor-tools.js` are now `string`. Companion to the `unity-mcp-plugin` 2.28.0 change. Fixes [#24](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/issues/24).

## [2.28.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **MCP JSON-RPC framing corrupted by debug logs on stdout** — Two `console.debug(...)` call sites in `src/unity-editor-bridge.js` and `src/tool-tiers.js` wrote diagnostic lines to stdout, which the MCP stdio transport reserves exclusively for JSON-RPC messages. Strict clients (Codex CLI) closed the transport on the first non-JSON chunk; lenient clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) tolerated it, which is why the bug escaped earlier detection. Both call sites now use `console.error(...)` so logs go to stderr. Fixes [#11](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/issues/11).

## [2.28.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **npm publish workflow** — Added `--allow-same-version` to `npm version` command to prevent CI failure when `package.json` already matches the release tag

## [2.28.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **SpriteAtlas tools** — 7 new tools for Unity SpriteAtlas management (contributed by [@zaferdace](https://github.com/zaferdace)):
  - `spriteatlas/create` — Create a new SpriteAtlas asset
  - `spriteatlas/info` — Get SpriteAtlas details (packed sprites, settings)
  - `spriteatlas/add` — Add sprites/folders to a SpriteAtlas
  - `spriteatlas/remove` — Remove entries from a SpriteAtlas

  - `spriteatlas/delete` — Delete a SpriteAtlas asset
  - `spriteatlas/list` — List all SpriteAtlases in the project
- New `spriteatlas-bridge.js` and `spriteatlas-tools.js` modules

### Added
- **npm auto-publish** — GitHub Action that automatically publishes to npm whenever a new GitHub release is created (contributed by [@vatanaksoytezer](https://github.com/vatanaksoytezer) in [#8](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/pull/8))

### Changed
- **npm package renamed** — Package renamed from `unity-mcp-server` to `anklebreaker-unity-mcp` to avoid name conflict on npm. Install via `npx anklebreaker-unity-mcp@latest`

### Fixed
- **UTF-8 encoding** — Fixed mojibake characters (corrupted em-dashes, arrows, section headers) across all comments in `unity-editor-bridge.js`; removed stale BOM
- **package-lock.json** — Synced version field to 2.27.0
